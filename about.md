I've worked as a system engineer at HPE since 2010.  Learning automation tools and techniques is interesting and the more I learn the more I see there is to learn.  A big part of my approach to solving problems is to understand everyone can contribute.  Everyone has ideas and often a great approach to solutions involves conversations with a focus on listening.
