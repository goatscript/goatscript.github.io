# System Engineer HPE - 2010-present
My career at HPE evolved from working on legacy email archiving projects, where my attention to detail ensured projects met deadlines and completed without errors.  Next, the group went through a hardware refresh, where my ability to generate creative solutions landed me with the task of designing our KVM architecture.  Now, with much persistence, I lead the effort to roll Chef into our datacenters and bring everything under version control.

- Test  with Foodciritc, Chefspec and Test Kitchen
- Hold Chef hackathons at HPE Pleasanton
- Using Gitlab to bring projects under version control

### KVM
